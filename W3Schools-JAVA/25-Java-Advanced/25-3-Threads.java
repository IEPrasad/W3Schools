Java Threads 

  ** Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing things at the same time. 

  ** Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program. 

Creating a Thread 

   ** There are two ways to create a thread. 
   
   ** It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method:

  Extend Syntax 

    public class Main extends Thread {
      public void run() {
        System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
      }
    }

  ** Another way to create a thread to implement the Runnable interface:

  Implement Syntax 

    public class Main implements Runnable {
      public void run() {
        System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
      }
    }

---

Running Threads 

  ** If the class extends the Thread class, the thread can be run by creating an
  instance of the class and call its start() method: 

Extend Example 

  public class Main extends Thread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main thread = new Main();
      thread.start();
      System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
    }

    public void run() {
      System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
    }
  }

  ** If the class implements the Runnable interface, the thread can be run by 
  passing an instance of the class to a Thread object's constructor and then calling the thread's start() method:

Implement Example

  public class Main implements Runnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main obj = new Main();
      Thread thread = new Thread(obj);
      thread.start();
      System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
    }

    public void run() {
      System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
    }
  }

Differences between "extending" and "implementing" Threads 

  ** The major differences is that when a class extends the Thread class, you cannot extend any other class, but by implementing the Runnable interface, it is possible to extend from another class as well, like: class MyClass extends OtherClass implements Runnable

---

Concurrency Problems 

  ** Because threads run at the same time as other of the program, there is no 
  way to know in which order the code will run. When the threads and main program 
  are reading and writing the same variables, the values are unpredictable. The 
  problems that result from this are called concurrency problems. 

Example 

  public class Main extends Thread {
    public static int amount = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main thread = new Main();
      thread.start();
      System.out.println(amount);
      amount++;
      System.out.println(amount);
    }

    public void run() {
      amount++;
    }
  }

  >>> 
    0
    2

To avoid concurrency problems, it is best to share as few attributes between 
threads as possible. If attributes need to be shared, one possible solution is to 
use the isAlive() method of the thread to check whether the thread has finished 
running before using any attributes that the thread can change. 

Example 

  ** Use isAlive() to prevent concurrency problems:

  public class Main extends Thread {
    public static int amount = 0;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main thread = new Main();
      thread.start();
      // Wait for the thread to finish 
      while(thread.isAlive()) {
        System.out.println("Waiting...");
      }
      // Update amount and print its value
      System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
      amount++;
      System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
    }

    public void run() {
      amount++;
    }
  }
