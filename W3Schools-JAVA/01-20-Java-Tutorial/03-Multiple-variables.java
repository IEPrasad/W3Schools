Java Declare Multiple Variables 

Declare Many Variables 
  ** To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list:

  Example
  Instead of writing:

  int x = 5;
  int y = 7;
  int z = 10;

  System.out.println(x + y + z);

  you can simply write:
  int x = 5, y = 7, z = 50;
  System.out.println(x + y + z);

---

One Value to Multiple Variables 

** You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line: 

Example
  int x, y, z:
  x = y = z = 50;

  System.out.println(x + y + z);
