Java Math 

** The Java Math class has many methods that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

--- Math.max(x,y)

** The Math.max(x,y) method can be used to find the highest value of x and y:

Example 
  Math.max(5, 10);
    >>> 10


--- Math.abs(x)

** The math.abs(x) method returns the absolute (positive) value of x:

Example
  Math.abs(-4.7);
    >>> 4.7

--- Random NUmbers 

** Math.random() returns a random number between 0.0 (inclusive), and 1.0 (exclusive):

Example
  Math.random();

  ** To get more control over the random number, for example, if you only want a random number between 0 and 100, you can use the following formula:

  Example 
    int randomNum = (int)(Math.random() * 101);   // 0 to 100
