Java Print Variables

Display Variables 

The println() method is often used to display variables.

To combine both text and a variable, use the + character:

Example

  String name = "John";
  System.out.println("Hello " + name);

** You can use also the + character to add a variable to another variable:

Example firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + lastName;
System.out.println(fullName);
