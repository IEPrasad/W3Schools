Java Identifiers 

Identifiers

All Java variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

Example:

// Good 
int minutePerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is 
int m = 60;


The general rules for naming variables are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
Names must begin with a letter
Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
Names can also begin with $ and _
Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names

// Student data
String studentName = "John Doe";
int studentID = 15;
int studentAge = 23;
float studentFee = 75.25f;
char studentGrade = 'B';

// Print variables
System.out.println("Student name: " + studentName);
System.out.println("Student id: " + studentID);
System.out.println("Student age: " + studentAge);
System.out.println("Student fee: " + studentFee);
System.out.println("Student grade: " + studentGrade);
