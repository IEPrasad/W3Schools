Java Threads 

  ** Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing things at the same time. 

  ** Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program. 

Creating a Thread 

   ** There are two ways to create a thread. 
   
   ** It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method:

  Extend Syntax 

    public class Main extends Thread {
      public void run() {
        System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
      }
    }

  ** Another way to create a thread to implement the Runnable interface:

  Implement Syntax 

    public class Main implements Runnable {
      public void run() {
        System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
      }
    }

---

Running Threads 

  ** If the class extends the Thread class, the thread can be run by creating an
  instance of the class and call its start() method: 

Extend Example 

  public class Main extends Thread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main thread = new Main();
      thread.start();
      System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
    }

    public void run() {
      System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
    }
  }

  ** If the class implements the Runnable interface, the thread can be run by 
  passing an instance of the class to a Thread object's constructor and then calling the thread's start() method:

Implement Example

  public class Main implements Runnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main obj = new Main();
      Thread thread = new Thread(obj);
      thread.start();
      System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
    }

    public void run() {
      System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
    }
  }
