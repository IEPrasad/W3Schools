PHP Install 

What Do I Need?
  
  ** To start using PHP, you can:

    > Find a web host with PHP and MySQL support
    > Install a web server on your own PC, and then install PHP and MySQL

** Use a Web Host With PHP Support

  ** If your server has activated support for PHP you do not need to do anything.

  ** Just create some .php files, place them in your web directory, and the server will parse them for you.

  ** You do not need to compile anything or install any extra tools.

  ** Because PHP is free, most web hosts offer PHP support.

Set Up PHP on Your Own PC

  ** However, if your server does not support PHP, you must:

    > install a web server
    > install PHP
    > install a database, such as MySQL

    ** The official PHP website (PHP.net) has installation instructions for PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/install.php
