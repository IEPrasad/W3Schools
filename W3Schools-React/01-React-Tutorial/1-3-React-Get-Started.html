<!-- // React Getting Started 

//   ** To use React in production, you need npm which is included with Node.js.
//         >> https://nodejs.org/

//   To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code directly in HTML.

//   But in order to use React in production, you need npm and Node.js installed.

//   ** Start by including three scripts, the first two let us write React code in our JavaScripts, and the third, Babel, allows us to write JSX syntax and ES6 in older browsers. 

//   ** You will learn more about JSX in the React JSX chapter.

// Example 

//   Include three CDN's in your HTML file:' -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="mydiv"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      function Hello() {
        return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
      }

      const container = document.getElementById('mydiv');
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
      root.render(<Hello />)
    </script>  
  </body>
    
</html>

  ** This way of using React can be OK for testing purposes, but for production you will need to set up a React environment.
