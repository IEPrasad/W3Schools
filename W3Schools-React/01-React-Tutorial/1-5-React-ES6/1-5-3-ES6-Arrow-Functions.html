React ES6 Arrow Functions 

Arrow Functions 

  ** Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

Example

  Before:

    hello = function() {
      return "Hello World!";
    }
  
Example 

    ** With Arrow Function:   

      hello = () => {
        return "Hello World!";
      }

** It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, 
you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:

Example 

  ** Arrow Function Return Value by Default:

  hello = () => "Hello World!";

---

** Note: This works only if the function has only one statement.

** If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:

Example

  ** Arrow Function With Parameters:

    hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;
  
** In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:

Example 

  ** Arrow Function Without Parentheses:
    
    hello = val => "Hello " + val;

---

What About this?

  ** The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular function.

  ** In short, with arrow functions there is no binding of this.

  ** In regular functions the this keyword represent the object that called the function, 
  which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

  ** With arrow function, the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

  ** Let us take a look at two examples to understand the difference.

  ** Both examples call a method twice, first when the page loads, and once again when the user 
  clicks a button.

  ** The first example uses a regular function, and the second example uses an arrow function.

  ** The result shows that the first example returns two different objects (window and button),
  and the second example returns the Header object twice.
