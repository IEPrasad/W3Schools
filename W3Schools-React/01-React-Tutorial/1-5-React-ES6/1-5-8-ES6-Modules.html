React ES6 Modules 

Modules 

  ** JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.

  ** This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.

  ** ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.

Export

  ** You can export a function or variable from any file.

  ** Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.

  ** There are two types of exports: Named and Default.

---

Named Exports

  ** You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once 
  at the bottom.

Example

  ** In-line individually:

  person.js

  <script>
    export const name = "Jesse"
    export const age = 40
  </script>

  All at once the bottom:

  person.js
  <script>
    const name = "Jesse"
    const age = 40

    export { name, age }
  </script>
