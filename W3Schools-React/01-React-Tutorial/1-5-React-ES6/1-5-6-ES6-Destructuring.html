React ES6 Destructuring 

Destructuring 

  ** To illustrate destructuring, we'll make a sandwich. Do you take everything out of the 
  refrigerator to make your sandwich? No, you only take out the items you would like to use on your 
  sandwich.

  ** Destructuring is exactly the same. We may have an array or object that we are working with, but 
  we only need some of the items contained in these.
  
  ** Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.

Destructuring Arrays 

  ** Here is the old way of assigning array items to a variable:

Example 

  Before 

    const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

    // old way 
    const car = vehicles[0];
    const truck = vehicles[1];
    const suv = vehicles[2];

  ** Here is the new way of assigning array items to a variable:

Example 

  const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

  const [cer, truck, suv] = vehicles;

** When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared is important.

---

** If we only want the car and suv we can simply leave out the truck but keep the comma:

  const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

  const [car,, suv] = vehicles;

** Destructuring comes in handy when a function returns an array:

Example 

  function calculate(a, b) {
    const add = a + b;
    const subtract = a - b;
    const multiply = a * b;
    const divide = a / b;

    return [add, subtract, multiply, divide];
  }

  const [add, subtract, multiply, divide] = calculate(4, 7);

---

Destructuring Objects 
  
  ** Here is the old way of using an object inside a function;

Example 
<script>
// Before:
    const vehicleOne = {
      brand: 'Ford',
      model: 'Mustang',
      Type: 'car',
      year: 2021,
      color: 'red'
    } 

  myVehicle(vehicleOne);

  // Old way1
  function myVehicle(vehicle) {
    const message = 'My ' + vehicle.type + ' is a ' + vehicle.color + ' ' + vehicle.brand + ' ' + vehicle.model + '.';
  }

// ** Here is the new way of using an object inside a function:

// Example
  // ** With destructuring:

  const vehicleOne = {
    brand: 'Ford',
    model: 'Mustang',
    type: 'car',
    year: 2021,
    color: 'red'
  }

  myVehicle(vehicleOne);

  function myVehicle({type, color, brand, model}) {
    const message = 'My ' + type + ' is a ' + color + ' ' + brand + ' ' + model + '.';
  }
</script>
 
** Notice that the object properties do not have to be declared in a specific order.

** We can even destructure deeply nested objects by referencing the nested object then using a colon and curly braces to again destructure the items needed from the nested object:

Example 

<script>
  const vehicleOne = {
    brand: 'Ford',
    model: 'Mustang',
    type: 'car',
    year: 2021,
    color: 'red',
    registration: {
      city: 'Houseton',
      state: 'Texas',
      country: 'USA'
    }
  }

  myVehicle(vehicleOne) 

  function myVehicle({ model, registration: { state } }) {
    const message = 'My ' + model + ' is registered in ' + state + '.';
  }
</script>
