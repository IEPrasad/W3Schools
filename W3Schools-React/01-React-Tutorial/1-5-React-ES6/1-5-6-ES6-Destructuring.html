React ES6 Destructuring 

Destructuring 

  ** To illustrate destructuring, we'll make a sandwich. Do you take everything out of the 
  refrigerator to make your sandwich? No, you only take out the items you would like to use on your 
  sandwich.

  ** Destructuring is exactly the same. We may have an array or object that we are working with, but 
  we only need some of the items contained in these.
  
  ** Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.

Destructuring Arrays 

  ** Here is the old way of assigning array items to a variable:

Example 

  Before 

    const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

    // old way 
    const car = vehicles[0];
    const truck = vehicles[1];
    const suv = vehicles[2];

  ** Here is the new way of assigning array items to a variable:

Example 

  const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

  const [cer, truck, suv] = vehicles;

** When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared is important.
