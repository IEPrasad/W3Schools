React ES6 Spread Operator 

Spread Operator 

  ** The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing 
  array or object into another array or object.

Example 

  <script>
    const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
    const numbersTwo = [2, 4, 6];
    const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];
  
  document.write(numbersCombined);
  </script>

** The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.

Example 

  ** Assign the first and second items from numbers to variables and put the rest in array:

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;

----

  ** We can use the spread operator with objects too:

Example

  ** Combine these two objects:

  const myVehicle = {
    brand: 'Ford',
    model: 'Mustang',
    color: 'red'
  }

  const updateMyVehicle = {
    type: 'car',
    year: 2021,
    color: 'yellow'
  }

  const myUpdateVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}
