React ES6 Classes 

Classes 

  ** ES6 introduced classes.

  ** A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we 
  use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned a constructor() method.

Example 

  ** A simple class constructor:

    class Car {
      constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
      }
    }

** Notice the case of the class name. We have begun the name, "Car", with an uppercase character. 
This is a standard naming convention for classes. 

** Now you can create objects using the Car class:

Example 
    
    class Car {
      constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
      } 
    }

    const mycar = new Car("Ford");

** Note: The constructor function is called automatically when the obejct is initialized.

Method in Classes 

  ** You can add your own method in a class:

Example

  ** Create a method named "present"

  class Car {
    constructor(name) {
      this.brand = name;
    }

    present() {
      return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
    }
  }

  const mycar = new Car("Ford");
  mycar.present();

  ** As you can see in the example above, you can call the method by referring to the object's method
  name followed by parentheses (parameters would go inside the parentheses).

---

Class Inheritance 

  ** To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.

  ** A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:

Example 

  ** Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class:

  class Car {
    constructor(name) {
      this.brand = name;
    }

    present() {
      return "I have a " + this.brand;
    }
  }

  class Model extends Car {
    constructor (name, mod) {
      super(name);
      this.model = mod;
    }

    show() {
      return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
    }
  }

  const mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
  mycar.show();


** The super() method refers to the parent class.

** By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method
   and get access to the parent's properties and methods.
