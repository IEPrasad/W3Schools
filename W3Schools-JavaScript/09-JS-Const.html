JavaScript Const 

  ** The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)
  ** Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared 
  ** Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned 
  ** Variables defined with const cannot have Block Scope 


Cannot be Reassigned 

  ** A variable defined with the const keyword cannot be reassigned 

Example 

  <script>
    const PI = 3.141592653589793;
    PI = 3.14;    // This will give an error 
    PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
  </script>

Must be Assigned 

  ** JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

Correct 
  <script> 
    const PI = 3.14159265389;
  </script>

Incorrect 
  <script>
    const PI;
    PI = 3.14159265389;
  </script>

When to use JavaScript const?

  ** Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not
  be changed.

  ** Use const when you declare:  

      > A new Array
      > A new object 
      > A new function 
      > A new RegExp

Constant Objects and Arrays 

  ** The keyword const is a little misleading.

  ** It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

  ** Because of this you can NOT:

    ** Reassign a constant value
    ** Reassign a constant array
    ** Reassign a constant object 

    But you CAN:
    
    ** Change the elements of constant array
    ** Change the properties of constant object

---

Constant Arrays

  ** You can change the elements of a constant array:

Example 

  <Script>
    // You can create a constant array:
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

    // You can change an element:
    cars[0] = "Toyota";

    // You can add an element:
    cars.push("Audi");
  </Script>

** But you can NOT reassign the array:

Example   
  <script> 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

    cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];   // ERROR
  </script>

---

Constant Object 

  ** You can change the properties of a constant object:

Example

  <script>
    // You can create a const object:
    const car = {type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white"};

    // You can change a property:
    car.color = "red";

    // You can add a property:
    car.owner = "Johnson";
  </script>

** But you can NOT reassign the object:

  <script> 
    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

    car = car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"};    // ERROR
  </script>

---

Block Scope
  ** Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.

  ** The x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared outside the block:

Example 

  <script>
    const x = 10;
    // Here x is 10

    {
      const x = 2;
      // here x is 2
    }

    // Here x is 10
  </script>

  ** You can learn more about block scope in the chapter JavaScript Scope
      >> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp

---

Redeclaring 

  ** Redeclaring a JavaScript var variable is allowed anywhere in a program:


Example

  <script>
    var x = 2;    // Allowed
    var x = 3;    // Allowed
    x = 4;        // Allowed 
  </script>

Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example 

  <script>
    var x = 2;    // Allowed 
    const x = 2;  // Not allowed 

    {
      let x = 2;    // Allowed 
      const x = 2;   // Not allowed
    }

    {
      const x = 2;    // Allowed 
      const x = 2;    // Not allowed 
    }
  </script>

** Reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example 

  <script>
    const x = 2;    // Allowed
    x = 2;          // Not allowed
    var x = 2;      // Not allowed
    let x = 2;      // Not allowed 
    const x = 2;    // Not allowed

    {
      const x = 2;    // Allowed
      x = 2;          // Not allowed
      var x = 2;      // Not allowed
      let x = 2;      // Not allowed 
      const x = 2;    // Not allowed
    }
  </script>

Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:

Example
  
  <script>
    const x = 2;      // Allowed

    {
      const x = 3;    // Allowed
    }

    {
      const x = 4;    /// Allowed
    }
  </script>

Hoisting 

  ** Variable defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time. 

  ** Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:

Example 

  ** This is OK:
  <script>  
    carName = "Volvo";
    var carName;
  </script>


** If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.

** Variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized.

** Meaning: Using a const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:


Example 

  <script>
    alert (carName);
    const carName = "Volvo";
  </script>
