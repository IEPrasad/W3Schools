JavaScript Assignment Operators

  ** Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.


  Operator	      Example	        Same As
    =	            x = y	          x = y
    +=	          x += y	        x = x + y
    -=	          x -= y	        x = x - y
    *=	          x *= y	        x = x * y
    /=	          x /= y	        x = x / y
    %=	          x %= y	        x = x % y
    **=	          x **= y	        x = x ** y

Shift Assignment Operators 
  
  Operator        Example	         Same As
  <<=             x <<= y	         x = x << y
  >>=	            x >>= y	         x = x >> y
  >>>=	          x >>>= y	       x = x >>> y

---

Bitwise Assignment Operators 

  Operator        Example         Same As 
  &=  	          x &= y	        x = x & y
  ^=	            x ^= y	        x = x ^ y
  |=	            x |= y	        x = x | y

---

Logical Assignment Operators 

  
  Operator	      Example	        Same As
  &&=	            x &&= y	        x = x && (x = y)
  ||=	            x ||= y	        x = x || (x = y)
  ??=	            x ??= y	        x = x ?? (x = y)

---

Note 

  ** The Logical assignment operators are ES2020

---

The = Operator 

  ** The Simple Assignment Operator assigns a value to a variable.

Simple Assignment Examples 

  let x = 10;

  let x = 10 + y;

---

The += Operator 

  ** The Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable.

Addition Assignment Examples 

  let x = 10;
  x += 5;

  let text = "Hello"; text += " World";

---

The -= Operator

  ** The Subtraction Assignment Operator subtracts a value from a variable.

Subtraction Assignment Example 

  let x = 10;
  x -= 5;

---

The *= Operator

  ** The Multiplication Assignment Operator multiplies a variable.

Multiplication Assignment Example

  let x = 10;
  x *= 5;

---

The **= Operator 


  ** The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a variable to the power of the operand.

Exponentiation Assignment Example

  let x = 10;
  x **= 5;

---

The /= Operator

  ** The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable.

Division Assignment Example 

  let x = 10;
  x /= 5;

---

The %= Operator 

  ** The Remainder Assignment Operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

Remainder Assignment Example

  let x = 10;
  x %= 5;

---

The <<= Operator 

  ** The Left Shift Assignment Operator left shifts a variable.

Left Shift Assignment Example

  let x = 100;
  x <<= 5;

---

The >>= Operator

  ** The Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (signed).

Right Shift Assignment Example 

  let x = -100;
  x >>= 5;

---

The >>>= Operator 

  ** The Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (unsigned).

Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Example 

  let x = -100;
  x >>>= 5;

---

The &= Operator 

  ** The Bitwise AND Assignment Operator does a bitwise AND operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

Bitwise AND Assignment Example 

  let x = 10;
  x &= 5;

---

The |= Operator

  ** The Bitwise OR Assignment Operator does a bitwise OR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable. 

Bitwise OR Assignment Example

  let x = 10;
  x |= 5;

---

The ^= Operator 

  ** The Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator does a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and assigns the results to the variable.

Bitwise XOR Assignment Example 

  let x = 10;
  x ^= 5;

---

The &&= Operator 

  ** The Logical AND assignment operator is used between two values.

  ** If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.

Logical AND Assignment Example 

  let x = 10;
  x &&= 5;

The &&= operator is an ES2020 feature.

---

The ??= Operator

  ** The Nullish coalescing assignment operator is used between two values. 

  ** If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.

Nullish Coalescing Assignment Example 

  let x;
  x ??= 5;

** The ??= operator is an ES2020 feature.
