JavaScript Operators

** JavaScript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations.


Example:

  The Assignment Operator = assign values
  The Addition Operator + adds values 
  The Multiplication Operator * multiplies values 
  The Comparison Operator > compares values 

---

JavaScript Assignments 

  ** The Assignment Operator ( = ) assign a value to a variable:

Assignment Examples

  let x = 10;

  // Assign the value 5 to x
  let x = 5;

  // Assign the value 2 to y
  let y = 2;

  // Assign the value x + y to z:
  let z = x + y;


JavaScript Addition

  ** The Addition Operator (+) adds numbers:

  ** Adding
  
  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x + y;


JavaScript Multiplication
  ** The Multiplication Operator (*) multiplies numbers:
  
  ** Multiplying

  let x = 5;
  let y = 2;
  let z = x * y;

      ** Arithmetic Operators 
      ** Assignment Operators
      ** Comparison Operators
      ** String Operators 
      ** Logical Operators
      ** Bitwise Operators

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

  ** Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Arithmetic Operators Example

  <script>
    let a = 3;
    let x = (100 + 50) * a;
  </script>

Operators           Description 

  +                 Addition 
  -                 Subtraction 
  *                 Multiplication
  **                Exponentiation (ES2016) 
                    >> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_2016.asp
  /                 Division 
  %                 Modulus (Division Remainder)
  ++                Increment
  --                Decrement 

** Note 
    - Arithmetic operators are fully described in the JS Arithmetic chapter.

JavaScript Assignment Operators

  ** Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
  ** The Addition Assignment Operator ( += ) adds a value to a variable. 

Assignment 
  
  ** let x = 10;
  ** x += 5;

  Operator	    Example	          Same As

  =	            x = y	            x = y
  +=            x += y            x = x + y
  -=            x -= y            x = x - y
  *=            x *= y            x = x * y
  /=            x /= y            x = x / y
  %=            x %= y            x = x % y
  **=           x **= y	          x = x ** y

JavaScript Comparison Operators

Operator            Description

==                  equal to 
===                 equal value and equal type
!=                  not equal 
!==                 not equal value or not equal type
>                   greater than 
<                   less than 
>=                  greater than or equal to
<=                  less than or equal to 
?                   ternary operator

---

** Note 
    - Comparison operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.

JavaScript String Comparison 

  ** All the comparison operators above can also used on strings:

Example
  <script>
    let text1 = "A";
    let text2 = "B";
    let result = text1 < text2;
  </script>

** Note that strings are compared alphabetically:

Example

  <script>
    let text1 = "20";
    let text2 = "5";
    let result = text1 < text2;
  </script>

---

JavaScript String Addition 

  ** The + can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

Example

  <script>
    let text1 = "John";
    let text2 = "Doe";
    let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;
  </script>

** The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

Example

  <script>
    let text1 = "What a very "; 
    text1 += "nice day";
  </script>

** The result of text1 will be:
  What a very nice day

---

** Note   
    - When use on strings, the + operator is called the concatenation operator.

---

Adding Strings and Numbers

  ** Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:

Example 
  <script>
    let x = 5 + 5;
    let y = "5" + 5;
    let x = "Hello" + 5;
  </script>

** The result of x,y, and z will be:

  10
  55
  Hello5

** Note 
    - If a add a number and a string, the result will be a string!

---

Javascript Logical Operators

  Operator          Description

  &&                logical and 
  ||                logical or
  !                 logical not 

** Note 
    - Logical operators are fully described in the JS Comparison chapter.

---

Javascript Type Operators

  Operator            Description 

  typeof              Returns the type of a variable 
  instanceof          Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

** Note    
    - Type operators are fully described in the JS Type Conversion chapter.

JavaScript Bitwise Operators

  ** Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.

  ** Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.

  Operator Description            Example       Same as         Result    Decimal

  &        AND                    5 & 1         0101 & 0001     0001      1
  |        OR                     5 | 1         0101 | 0001     0101      5
  ~        NOT                      ~5          ~0101           1010      10
  ^        XOR                    5 ^ 1         0101 ^ 0001     0100      4
  <<       left shift             5 << 1        0101 << 1       1010      10
  >>       right shift            5 >> 1        0101 >> 1       0010      2
  >>>      unsigned right shift   5 >>> 1       0101 >>> 1      0010      2


  

The examples above uses 4 bits unsigned examples. But JavaScript uses 32-bit 
signed numbers. Because of this, in JavaScript, ~ 5 will not return 10. It will 
return -6.
~00000000000000000000000000000101 will return 11111111111111111111111111111010

Bitwise operators are fully described in the JS Bitwise chapter.
