JavaScript Data Types 

JavaScript has 8 Datatypes 

  >> String 
  >> Number 
  >> Bight 
  >> Boolean 
  >> Undefined
  >> Null 
  >> Symbol
  >> Object 

The Object Datatype

  ** The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects:
  
  ** Built-in object types can be:

  ** Objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, and more.

---

Example 
  <script>
    
    // Numbers:
    let length = 16;
    let weight = 7.5;

    // Strings:
    let color = "Yellow";
    let lastName = "Johnson";

    // Booleans: 
    let x = true;
    let y = false;

    // Object: 
    const person = {fristName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

    // Array object:
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

    // Data object:
    const date = new Date("2025-01-02");
  </script>

Note 
  ** A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.

---

The Concept of Data Types 

  ** In programming, data types is an important concept.

  ** To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

  ** Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

  <script>
    let x = 16 + "Volvo";
  </script>

  ** Does it makes any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result?

  ** JavaScript will treat the example above as:

  <script>
    let x = "16" + "Volvo";
  </script>

---

Note 

  ** When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

Example 

  let x = 16 + "Volvo"
    >>> 16Volvo
  
  let x = "Volvo" + 16
    >>> Volvo16

** JavaScript evaluate expressions from left to right. Different sequences can 
produce different results:

  <script>
    let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
      // >>> 20Volvo
  </script>

  <script>
    let x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
      // >>> Volvo164
  </script>

---

** In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo".

** In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operand are treated as strings.

---

JavaScript Types are Dyanamic 

  ** JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:

Example 

  <script>
    let x;    // Now x is undefined
    x = 5;    // Now x is a Number
    x = "John";   // Now x is a String
  </script>

---

JavaScript Strings

  ** A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

  ** Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.

Example

  <script>
    // Using double quotes:
    let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

    // Using single quotes:
    let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';
  </script>

** You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes 
surrounding the string:

Example

  <script>
    // Single quote inside double quotes:
    let answer1 = "It's alright";

    // Single quotes inside double quotes:
    let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";

    // Double quotes inside single quotes:
    let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
  </script>

  ** You will learn more about strings later in this tutorial.

---

JavaScript Numbers

  ** All JavaScript numbers are stored s decimal numbers (floating point).
  ** Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

Example
  <script>
    // With decimals:
    let x1 = 34.00;

    // Without decimals:
    let x2 = 34;
  </script>

---

Exponential Notation 

  ** Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:

Example 

  <script>
    let y = 123e5;    // 12300000
    let z = 123e - 5;   // 0.00123
  </script>

---

Note 
  ** Most programming languages have many number types:

  ** Whole numbers (integers):
  ** byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

  ** Real numbers (floating-point):
  ** float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

  ** JavaScript numbers are always one type:
  ** double (64-bit floating point).

  ** You will learn more about numbers later in this tutorial.

JavaScript BigInt

  ** All JavaScript numbers are stored a 64-bit floating-point format.

  ** JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store 
  integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

---

Example

  <script>
     let x = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
  </script>

** You will learn more about BigInt later in this tutorial.

---

JavaScript Booleans 

  ** Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

Example 
  <script>
    let x = 5;
    let y = 5;
    let z = 6;
    (x == y)    // Returns true
    (x == z)    // Returns false
  </script>

** Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

** You will learn more about booleans later in this tutorial.

---

JavaScript arrays

  ** JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

  ** Arrays items are separated by commas.

  ** The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):

Example

  <script> 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  </script>

** Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], ans so on.


** You will learn more about arrays later in this tutorial.

---

JavaScript Objects 

  ** JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

  ** Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

Example

  <script>
    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
  </script>

The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age and eyeColor.

** You will learn more about objects later in this tutorial.

---

The typeof Operator.

  ** You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

  ** The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:

Example

<script>
  typeof ""             // Returns "string"
  typeof "John"         // Returns "string"
  typeof "John Doe"     // Returns "string"
</script>

---

Example

  <script>
    typeof 0              // Returns "number"
    typeof 314            // Returns "number"
    typeof 3.14           // Returns "number"
    typeof (3)            // Returns "number"
    typeof (3 + 4)        // Returns "number"
  </script>

** You will learn more about typeof later in this tutorial.

---

Undefined

  ** In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. 
  The type is also undefined.

Example

  <script>
    let cars;   // Value is undefined, type is undefined
  </script>

** Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.

Example

  <script>
    car = undefined;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
  </script>

---

Empty Values 

  ** An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.

  ** An empty string has both a legal value and a type.

Example

  <script>
    let car = "";   // The value is "", the typeof is "string"
  </script>

full of the code for this example 

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <body>
    <h1>JavaScript Datatypes</h1>

    <p>An empty string has both a legal value and a type:</p>

    <div id="demo"></div>

    <script>
      let car = '';

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The value is: " + car + "<br>" + "the type is: " + typeof car;
    </script>
  </body>
  </html>

  >>>
    ...
    The value is:
    the type is: string
